**Abstract**: 
Freshwater inputs to coastal marine ecosystems can introduce biogeochemical conditions that differ markedly from ambient seawater. This distinct biogeochemistry can affect important physiological processes to the organisms that inhabit these ecosystems. A common source of freshwater to coastal marine ecosystems, like coral reefs, is submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) which is fresh or brackish water that naturally enters the ocean from terrestrial zones by passing through aquifers or the marginal seabed. Using a series of SGD dilutions (0-4% SGD by volume) from two SGD sources with unique biogeochemical conditions, we analyzed the effect of SGD on the metabolism of a dominant tropical fringing reef coral, Pocillopora acuta. We showed that respiration, gross photosynthesis, and calcification rates were significantly affected by the SGD dilutions, with respiration and gross photosynthesis responding in a non-linear, u-shaped pattern and calcification linearly decreasing as SGD increased. Notably, the patterns were consistent between the two SGD sources. This study highlights the direct impacts that land-sea processes, such as SGD, can have on coral physiology. Because SGD fluxes are changing globally, the biogeochemical composition and the prevalence of SGD may intensify in coastal ecosystems, which can have varying impacts on the constituents of those ecosystems.
